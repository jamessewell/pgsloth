The Postgres extension that believes in taking its sweet, sweet time. 🦥

Tired of fast queries? Let’s slow things down. 🤙

No hustle. No pressure. Just relaxed, unbothered, barely-scalable performance.

Key Features:
💤 Query Nap Mode - Takes a break mid-query. It deserves it ✅
🏝️ Relaxed Replication - Data gets there…eventually. (to be implemented)
🌀 Index-Free Indexing - Because the journey is the destination. (to be implemented)

Your query might run in 3 seconds… or 3 hours. Honestly? We’re not checking.
